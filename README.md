Storage
=======

A Storage Management System


This project will conduct to a program which can record the import and export of a storage
and also monitor the temperature and humidity in it, in order to keep the stored food to be 
fresh.The real situation I'm facing is that the whole storage has 18 pits and goods mostly 
are potatoes.

To make a MIS, I use WPF with the MVVM pattern to develop, SQL Server as the database, Linq
to SQL as the technique to access database,and last but not least a set of equipments will 
provide temperature and humidity data by using Zigbee.
